## anon-verify
This is an open-source bounty request for members of the solana community to contribute to the 888 Anon Club. We are putting out a bounty for junior-intermediate devs to develop a clean UI which allows users to check their 888AC NFT in their wallet is legit. This will become a part of the 888AC website/clubhouse and thus should be a great rendition of these simple verify tools. Below you will find a list of requirements. 

### Requirements
Login with Phantom / Sollet etc using solana/wallet-adapter you should be able to integrate many / all wallets neccessary. 
Automatically detect if the user has an 888AC NFT and verify it - if there are multiple then show all that are verified. 
A 'Manual' tab which allows you to check if the token address you have is within the official hash list. 

#### Expected user-flow 
1. User makes their way to verify.888anon.xyz 
2. They are prompted to login to their wallet
3. The verification check is run to automatically check the 888AC NFT's in their wallet
4. If 888AC NFT's are found show them with verify checkmark. 
5. if 888AC NFT's are not found prompt user with error - ask them if they'd like to manually check a token addr.

#### Contributing to this bounty 
Create a fork of the project which right now should be an empty git with only this readme. As you work through the project keep me informed on discord and i will discuss with you as you build. You should be familiar with pull requests to repositories you have forked. Bounty payment will depend on your total contribution %
